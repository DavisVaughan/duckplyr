# duckplyr

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of duckplyr is to define a set of generics that provide a low-level implementer's interface for dplyr's high-level API.

## Installation

You can install the development version of duckplyr from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak", repos = sprintf("https://r-lib.github.io/p/pak/stable/%s/%s/%s", .Platform$pkgType, R.Version()$os, R.Version()$arch))
pak::pak("duckdblabs/duckplyr")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(duckdb)
library(duckplyr)

# Use `as_duckplyr_df()` to enable processing with duckdb:
out <-
  palmerpenguins::penguins %>%
  as_duckplyr_df() %>%
  transmute(bill_area = bill_length_mm * bill_depth_mm, bill_length_mm, species, sex) %>%
  filter(bill_length_mm < 40) %>%
  select(-bill_length_mm)

# The result is a data frame or tibble, with its own class.
class(out)
names(out)

# duckdb is responsible for eventually carrying out the operations:
out %>%
  explain()

# The contents of this data frame are computed only upon request:
out

# Once computed, the results remain available as a data frame:
out
```
